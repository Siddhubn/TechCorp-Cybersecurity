# TechCorp Website for Cybersecurity Workshop

This repository contains the source code for the **TechCorp** website, developed to demonstrate ethical hacking and cybersecurity concepts, including **brute-forcing**, during a workshop. 

The website includes a simulated **Employee Portal** for practicing various security testing techniques using tools like **Burp Suite**.
